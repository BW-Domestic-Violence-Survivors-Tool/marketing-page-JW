## Product Specifications
* A domestic violence survivor can come to the page and insert their data into the online calculator.
* There will be two steps to the calculator, a personal monthly budget to determine what costs they need to cover, and a way to calculate the costs of relocating
* The monthly personal budget will allow them to enter their ongoing unavoidable costs they might have while trying to relocate.
* The relocation costs include multiple possiblities that a survivor will have to consider.
* After they have entered these fields, a page will show up combining their total monthly expenses plus the monthly cost of relocation.
