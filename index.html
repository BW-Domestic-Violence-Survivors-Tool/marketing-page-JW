          <h2>Why A Calculator?</h2>
          <p>
            There are many expenses when it comes to getting out of a bad situation. Some you can account for down to a penny. 
            Some you estimate as best you can. This calculator will allow you to input, save, and even compare those costs. 
            We know some of it is best guesstimate, but it will give you a starting place to budget and plan if your 
            situation doesn't call for immediate action.
          </p>
          <p class="hotline">If you are in immediate trouble, 
            please call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at <a href="tel:18007997233">1-800-799-7233 (SAFE)</a> .
